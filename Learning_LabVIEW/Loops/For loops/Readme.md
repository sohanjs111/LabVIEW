# Loops

## For Loops

Repeat a section of code a set number of times

## For Loops Vs While Loops

**While you know how many times a loop will need to execute before starting it, use a FOR loops**

Example: individually processing each element in an array

**While you do not know how many times a loop will need to execute, use a WHILE loops**

Example: processes that repeat until the user stops the program
