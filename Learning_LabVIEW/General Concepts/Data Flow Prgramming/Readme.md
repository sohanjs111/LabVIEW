# General Concepts 

## Data Flow Programming

* Wires pass data between block diagram nodes
* Movement of data determines order of execution 
* A node begins execution after it receives all inputs
* When a node finishes, it can pass output data to other nodes. 


> LabVIEW usually organized to execute from left (input) to right (output).
